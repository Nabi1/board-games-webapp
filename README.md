### Introduction

This project is a kind of sanbox showing the implmentation of a dashboard for oard Games. The dashboard is a single-page application that displays a list of Board Games. The application allows users to view, rename, duplicate, and delete Board Games, as well as filter Games by category and search for Games by name.

### Requirements üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

The page must contain:

1. **List of Games**: Display a list of Games with the following details:

- Name of the Games
- A drop-down menu with options ‚Äúrename,‚Äù ‚Äúduplicate,‚Äù and ‚Äúdelete‚Äù

2. **Categories Filter**: Implement a filter by category. The filter should:

- Allow filtering by only one category at once
- Persist the filter by URL when the page is refreshed

3. **Games Details**: Provide a path that links to a detailed view of each Games, and a very basic view of the Games.

4. **Search Functionality**: Implement a search functionality to find Games.

5. **Countdown Timer**: Display a countdown of the time remaining before the next online party.

### Folder Structure üè¢

The project follows a modular folder structure, with each module containing its own components, tests and types.

### Unit Testing

In this project, unit tests adhere to the Arrange, Act, Assert (AAA) principle, ensuring consistency and readability. Element selection for testing follows the query priority guide recommended by Testing Library [Testing Library Query Priority](https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/about/#priority).

### Search Functionality üîç

The search input launches a search query when the user types in the input field. The search query filters the list of BoardGames by name and scrip's name, and the filtered list is displayed in the UI. The search query is case-insensitive.

### React Hooks location ‚öìÔ∏è
